In high-level interpreted languages such as R, this also is a means of improving efficiency by making use of loops implemented in lower level source code (e.g. C). While loops (`for`, `while`, `apply()`, etc.) have their place in well-written R code,  it is often the case that inefficient or bloated R code can be improved through vectorization."
