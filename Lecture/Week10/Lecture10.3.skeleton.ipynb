    "Vectorization can be particularly useful in Monte Carlo studies where we might otherwise be inclined to use explicit loops. We will look at some examples after an introduction to Monte Carlo estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and data science we are often interested in computing expectations (means) of random outcomes of various types.\n",
    "When analytic expectations are unavailable or cumbersome to compute, it can be useful to obtain Monte Carlo approximations by simulating a random process and then directly averaging the values of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because the sample average is generally a good estimate of the corresponding expectation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\theta}_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i / n \\rightarrow_p \\theta = E(X)$$\n",

    "- `rt()` - the t-distribution\n",

    "\n",
    "As an aside, you should be aware that each of the distribution families above have corresponding `d*`, `p*`, and `q*` functions for computing densities, percentiles (CDF), or quantiles (inverse CDF) for each distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call one of the `r*` functions to generate random draws from a distribution, R relies on a pseudo-random number generate to generate from `U(0,1)`\n",
    " and produce the results. Thus the outcome of these calls depends on the current state of the generator. It is sometimes desirable to reproduce exactly the same pseudo-random sequence. You can do this by fixing the random seed using set.seed() which takes an integer argument. The function `RNGkind()` can be used to display or set the random number generator.\n",
